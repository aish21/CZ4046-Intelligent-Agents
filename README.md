## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Why Agents
- 5 trends - 
* Ubiquity - continual reduction in cost of computing - introduce processing power in many devices (Pervasiveness)
* Interconnection - Computer systems  networked into large distributed systems
Intelligence - The complexity of tasks that we are capable of automating and delegating to computers has grown steadily
Delegation - giving control to computers - without our intervention, ties with intelligence
Human Orientation - movement away from machine-oriented views of programming - higher level understanding - human abstractions
Agent - An agent is a computer system that is capable of independent action on behalf of its user, situated in some environment capable of autonomous action to meet delegated objectives. 
Multi-Agent Systems - A system that consists of a number of agents which interact with one another - cooperate, coordinate and negotiate - computational, information processing entities.
MAS - Interdisciplinary - infusing the methodologies of different fields 
Views - 
Paradigm for software engineering - interaction is the most important characteristic of complex software - develop tools in which interaction is the norm
Tools for understanding human societies - MAS provide novel ways of simulating societies - shed light on social processes.
Objections - 
Distributed Systems? Agents are autonomous, capable of making independent decisions - mechanisms to coordinate their activities. Self-interested for their interactions are economic
AI? Classical AI ignores social aspects of agency - important parts of intelligent activity in real-world setting
Economics / Game Theory? Game Theory is descriptive concepts - does not tell us how to compute solutions (need resource bounded, computational agents) - some assumptions also may not be valid 
Social Science? No reason to believe that artificial societies are constructed the same way human societies are - not subsumption
Applications - 
Individual agents - autonomous actions - high risk simulations unsuitable for humans - spacecraft control, personal software agents - e-commerce, proactive - degree of autonomy varies -> as agents get better, research issues arise
MAS - for processes where control, data and expertise is distributed, centralised control is impractical and nodes have conflicting objectives - Air traffic control, business process management
