	 Recall that in the 2-players dilemma, U(DC) > U(CC) > U(DD) > U(CD), where
	 we give the payoff for the first player in the list. We want the three-player game 
	 to resemble the 2-player game whenever one player's response is fixed, and we
	 also want symmetry, so U(CCD) = U(CDC) etc. This gives the unique ordering

	 In this simulation, triples of players will play each other repeatedly in a
	 'match'. A match consists of about 100 rounds, and your score from that match
	 is the average of the payoffs from each round of that match. For each round, your
